# MAE 3187 - Numerical Solution of a Two-Dimensional, Transient Temperature Distribution in a Rectangular Domain

An aluminum plate is being cooled along two adjecent sides with chilled water.  The two other sides are are being heated with strip heaters as shown in the figure below.  Initially, the aluminum is at room temperature before these boundary conditionas are imposed.  As the plate has thermal inertia, the temperature distribution in the plate will change with time and eventually reach steady state.

Find the temperature distribution after 90 seconds, 360 seconds, and at steady state.
